=========

xkcd style matplotlib plots from my thesis

prerequisits
============

you need ipython, python-notebook, matplotlib, pylab, ... and possibly more

how to run
==========

from the command line type 
``` ipython notebook '''

A browser window should pop up, running an ipython session where you can select the All.ipynb notebook.

Open it, and do a "Run All". All cells will be evaluated. All but the first two can be manipulated by you. play around!
